üß≠ TL;DR Summary
Layer	Purpose
company_financials	Daily data capture (operational P&L)

Would you like me to include a fourth table ‚Äî company_donor_balances ‚Äî that automatically keeps a running balance (donations minus repayments minus profits returned)? It‚Äôs optional but makes reporting simpler.
